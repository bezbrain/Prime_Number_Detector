# Prime_Number_Detector

After seeing the challenges that could be faced to detect if a number is prime or not especially when we have large number in hundred, thousand or even million involved, I decided to look into it.

In order to tackle this problem, I decided to build this web page which allows users to detect if a number is a prime number or not irrespective of how large the number is.

YOU MAY CHECK IT OUT AND USE IT TO YOUR BENEFIT ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT YOUR NEPHEW OR NIECE ASKS YOU, ‚ÄúUNCLE, IS 2457 A PRIME NUMBER?‚Äù.üòÉ YOU WOULD NOT NEED TO RACK YOUR BRAIN UNNECESSARILY.
